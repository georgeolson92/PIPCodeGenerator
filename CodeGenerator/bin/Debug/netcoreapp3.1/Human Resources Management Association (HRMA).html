<H1>Human Resources Management Association (HRMA)</H1>

<p>Welcome to the PSU Human Resource Management Association! We are a student chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), sponsored by the Portland Human Resource Management Association (PHRMA). PSU HRMA helps prepare students to step out into the real world with appropriate knowledge, skills, and the confidence to be successful. We are also a community that learns together, grows together, and succeeds together. We frequently invite alumni, who are currently working in the HR field, to come back and share their stories and experience with our current members.</p>
