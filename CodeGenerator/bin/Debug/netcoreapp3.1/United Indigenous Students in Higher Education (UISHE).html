<H1>United Indigenous Students in Higher Education (UISHE)</H1>

<p>UISHE is a student group working to promote native and tribal cultures, education, healthy lifestyles, and the advancement of native self-determination. We strive to help students maintain their individual traditional indigenous customs and achieve success in higher education. We also provide a base for cultural education to the non-Native community.</p>
