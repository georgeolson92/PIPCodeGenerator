<H1>Game and Entertainment Making Students</H1>

<p>GEMS is a creative space for collaborative students to develop their own games. We strive to improve our skills and make the games we want to play. The club is a resource to help the creation of games either through teaching new skills, fostering collaboration, or exchanging ideas and opinions.</p>
