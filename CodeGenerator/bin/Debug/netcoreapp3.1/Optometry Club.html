<H1>Optometry Club</H1>

<p>The Optometry Club is where students can socialize and express their interest in optometry. We want to impact the world by helping the community around us. Networking with OD's, shadowing students in preparation for application, and exploring the field's frontiers and different specialized practices are examples of things we do. </p>
