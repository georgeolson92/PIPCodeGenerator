<H1>Environmental Club</H1>

<p>Environmental Club focuses on student shared knowledge regarding sustainability, environmental justice and science related issues on campus. We host environmental awareness and sustainability events in urban and rural settings. The goal is to unite the common interests of students through projects to build connections within and outside the PSU community.</p>
