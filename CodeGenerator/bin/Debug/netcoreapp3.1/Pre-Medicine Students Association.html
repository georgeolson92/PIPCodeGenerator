<H1>Pre-Medicine Students Association</H1>

<p>PreMSA's goal is to build a community, in which all pre-medicine students can participate in volunteering and learning events. Networking opportunities with physicians and medical or graduate students will be offered, as well as activities to enhance the individual experience of pre-medicine students in their journey towards a medical career.</p>
