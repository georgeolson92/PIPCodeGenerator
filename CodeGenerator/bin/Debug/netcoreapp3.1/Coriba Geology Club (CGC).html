<H1>Coriba Geology Club (CGC)</H1>

<p>CoRiBa is dedicated to promoting, enjoying and learning about geology. Students have access tools and resources that can be expensive or hard to find. We invite speakers to campus to present topics of interest, and organize field trips and hikes to cool places to see geology out in the open.</p>
