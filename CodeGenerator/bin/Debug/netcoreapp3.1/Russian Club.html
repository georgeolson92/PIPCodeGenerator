<H1>Russian Club</H1>

<p>We unite students in the common interest of Russian as a language and as a culture. We aspire to get as many students as possible involved in the Russian speaking community here in Portland and to promote intercultural understanding between the Russian/Slavic communities and students here at PSU.</p>
