<H1>Japanese Student Society</H1>

<p>Japanese Student Society of Portland State University is a student-run group representing the Japanese community and its culture on campus. We do this through events and services that both educate the campus while empowering Japanese people to fully own their identity heritage by constructively challenging misrepresentation, misappropriation, stereotype, and racism.</p>
