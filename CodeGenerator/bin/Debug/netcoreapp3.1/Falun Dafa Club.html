<H1>Falun Dafa Club</H1>

<p>Falun Dafa is an advanced self-cultivation practice of the Buddha School to improve mind and body. It includes five gentle exercises, including a sitting meditation. Practitioners also cultivate moral character, assimilating to truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance.  We would like to introduce this wonderful practice to the larger PSU community.</p>
