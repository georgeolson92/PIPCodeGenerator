<H1>Arabic Language and Culture Student Association</H1>

<p>The Arabic Language and Culture Student Association aims to provide an additional resource to students of PSU's Arabic language program in order to reinforce our learning. This association has been formed to directly address the need for an accessible, consistent forum where students may reinforce the material learned inside the classroom, as well as provide a necessary resource for breaks in the school year.</p>
