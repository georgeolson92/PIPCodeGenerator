<H1>Kuwaiti Student Club</H1>

<p>To accommodate the increasing number of students from Kuwait, this club is to function as a medium between the students and PSU. New and existing students from Kuwait often feel the need to connect with other students from their country so this will fill the void of studying abroad.</p>
