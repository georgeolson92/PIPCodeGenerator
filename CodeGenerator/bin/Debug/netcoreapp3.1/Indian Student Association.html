<H1>Indian Student Association</H1>

<p>Our mission is to provide students and the community of Portland with a link to Indian culture by hosting a variety of events around traditions, lifestyle and culture interspersed with informal meetings throughout the academic year. We allow Indian students a chance to network among themselves while adjusting to Portland.</p>
