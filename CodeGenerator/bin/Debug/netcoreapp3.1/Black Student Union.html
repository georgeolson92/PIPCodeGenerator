<H1>Black Student Union</H1>

<p>BSU serves as a social, intellectual and political community for students of the African diaspora through education, organizing and action. Due to the lack of African student representation, we come together for the purpose of establishing visibility on campus for recruitment, retention and success of individuals within our community.</p>
