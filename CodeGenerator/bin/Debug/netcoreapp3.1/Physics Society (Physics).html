<H1>Physics Society (Physics)</H1>

<p>The PSU Physics Society is about helping students, and the community at large, develop a greater understanding and appreciation of physics. We seek to help students transition into and from academics, provide exposure to skills and knowledge that will help students post-college, and to promote having fun with physics.</p>
